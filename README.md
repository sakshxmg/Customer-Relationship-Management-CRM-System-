Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System - SQL Database Project

Developed a comprehensive SQL-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System designed to streamline the management of customer data, track sales transactions, and analyze marketing campaign effectiveness.

Advanced Querying: Implemented complex SQL queries to analyze customer segmentation, product performance, sales trends, and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
Automation: Automated the generation of key reports, such as monthly sales summaries and customer interaction logs, using stored procedures and scheduled tasks.
Business Impact: The system enabled better customer retention strategies, optimized sales operations, and improved the ROI of marketing campaigns through targeted analysis.
